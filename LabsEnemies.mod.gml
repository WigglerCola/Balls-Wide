//nothing here yet, this is where all the enemies for Labs Route will be stored probably, for other parts/chapters or whatever they end up being called have a seperate file probably
//also make sure to comment things to make it so its easily findable with the search function 'Roller Turret Code' Etc, just to make it a bit more manageable.
//BOSSES ARE GOING TO BE STORED SEPERATELY IN THEIR OWN FILES, labs bosses included.
//Any custom projectiles they might end using will probably be in here aswell, so this file is likely going to be pretty annoying to manage, but at least it shouldn't cause performance issues.
